Your Next Steps:

Choose Your E2E Tool: Decide between Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress based on your comfort level and project needs.
Set Up Test Environment: Ensure you have a stable deployment environment for testing.
Plan Data Management: Decide how you will manage the initial state for your tests (setup/teardown, dedicated accounts, etc.). This is often the most time-consuming part.
Prepare Excel/Data Source: Finalize your Excel sheet and decide how your test scripts will read the expected values.
Write Your First E2E Test: Start with one of the scenarios you defined. Focus on getting the basic flow working: login -> navigate -> perform actions -> find element -> assert value.
